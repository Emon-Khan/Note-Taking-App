I have use merge sort for sorting the array, then for finding the index of the target value.I use 2 pointer technique.Here I can use quick sort but there can occur some cases where the sorting will go under worst case scenario.And in worst case scenario quick sort gives O(n^2) time complexity.Whereas in merge sort in all scenario we can have our desired sorted array in O(nlog(n)) time complexity.
